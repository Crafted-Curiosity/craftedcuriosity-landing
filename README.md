# Crafted Curiosity – Coming Soon Landing Page

This repository hosts a simple **Coming Soon** page for **Crafted Curiosity**.

## 🌐 How it works

1. **Netlify hosting** serves `index.html` from the `main` branch.
2. 🚀 This site is now hosted on Netlify: [www.craftedcuriosity.org](https://www.craftedcuriosity.org)
3. All subdomains like `fit.`, `bakery.`, etc. point via CNAME in Namecheap to:`crafted-curiosity.github.io.`
4. So all subdomains show this shared landing page.
5. Later, replace subdomain with their own repos + `CNAME` file as needed.
