# Crafted Curiosity ‚Äì Coming Soon Landing Page

This repository hosts a simple **Coming Soon** page for **Crafted Curiosity**.

## üåê How it works

1. **GitHub Pages** serves `index.html` from the `main` branch.
2. All subdomains like `fit.`, `bakery.`, etc. point via CNAME in Namecheap to:`crafted-curiosity.github.io.`
3. So all subdomains show this shared landing page.
4. Later, replace subdomain with their own repos + `CNAME` file as needed.
